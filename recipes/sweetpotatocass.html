            <br>
            This sweet potato casserole with marshmallows toes the line between side dish and dessert â€” and we wouldn't have it any other way. Pureed sweet potatoes are blended with sugar and spices, then topped with marshmallows and baked to sweet, gooey perfection.            <br>
            <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>5 sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp orange juice</li>
                    <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>1 (10.5 ounce) package miniature marshmallows</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Place sweet potatoes in a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain, and mash.</li>
                    <li>Place mashed sweet potatoes in a large bowl. Add brown sugar, margarine, orange juice, and cinnamon; mix with an electric mixer until blended.</li>
                    <li>Spread evenly into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle marshmallows over top.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is heated through and marshmallows are puffed and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
