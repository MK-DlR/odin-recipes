            Puppy Chow (Muddy Buddies) is a classic snack mix that everyone loves! Rice Chex coated in a silky mixture of chocolate and peanut butter all coated in powdered sugar.<br>
            <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>9 cups Rice Chex</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips</li>
                    <li>1 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup butter</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
                    <li>3 cups powdered sugar</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pour cereal into a large bowl (if the bowl has a lid, even better) and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a medium microwave-safe bowl heat together the chocolate chips, peanut butter, and butter for 30 seconds. Stir, and repeat heating until mixture is smooth. Stir in the vanilla.</li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture on top of the cereal and gently stir until all the cereal is coated.</li>
                    <li>If your bowl has a lid, pour the powdered sugar on top of the cereal mixture (alternately you can do this in a large 2- gallon sized zip-top bag). Cover or seal and gently shake until the powdered sugar coats all the cereal. Break up clumps as they form and shake again.</li>
